## **Scavenger Hunt**  
This challenge is similar to **Insp3ct0r**; we find the first and second part of the flag easily in the HTML and CSS part of the website respectively.

As soon as we get to the JavaScript file, we get the folloiwng hint - `How can I keep Google from indexing my website?`

We seem to have encountered the same issue in **where are the robots**; we need to access the `robots.txt` file where we append files for non-indexing. Accessing the [robots.txt](http://mercury.picoctf.net:55079/robots.txt) file of the server gives us the third part of the flag, as well as the next hint - `I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?`

Since the word `Access` was emphasized, I did a bit of googling with the hey words `https`,`Apache`, and `Access`, which led me to the discovery of controlof main configuration files on an Apache server by `.htaccess`, hence I visited the [.htaccess](http://mercury.picoctf.net:55079/.htaccess) file to get the fourth part of the flag and the next clue - `I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.`

Again, after much googling the keywords `Apple`, `Mac`, `Store`, and `folder`, I came to discover `.DS_Store`, a proprietary file system present on Apple Macintoshes to store custom attributes. Hence, visiting the [.DS_Store](http://mercury.picoctf.net:55079/.DS_Store) page brought me to the final part of the flag.
