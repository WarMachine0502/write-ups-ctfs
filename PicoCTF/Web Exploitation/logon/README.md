We are presented with a basic [login page](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/15796/) as shown.

As hinted by the description, the site only checks crdentials if the Username is `Joe`; all other Users are let through without any verification. Hence, the user `Joe` must have been assigned `admin` privileges, which led me to the cookie `admin` on the website that was `False` for all unverified users.

Changing the cookie's value from `False` to `True` gives us the flag.
