## **Insp3ct0r**  
We have a [basic website](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44924/) in the challenge, with instructions to inspect its code. Hence I opened up DevTools and looked at the HTML, which had a third of the flag as shown.

Since we are on the right track, I further look up the site's sources to see that the website also employs a `myjs.js` file and `mycss.css` file, which have the remaining two parts of the flag.
