## **where are the robots**  
We are provided with a basic [website](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/60915/) with the following content.

Since the challenge and the website prominently mentioned `robots`, I visited the [robots.txt](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/60915/robots.txt) page to get the non-indexed pages, which sure enough had [/8028f.html](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/60915/8028f.html) disallowed.

The [/8028f.html](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/60915/8028f.html) page had the flag.
