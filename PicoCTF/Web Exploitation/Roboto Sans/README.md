* **Roboto Sans**  
The challenge presents us a [promotional page](http://saturn.picoctf.net:64710/) with no apparent anomalies. However, since the title of the challenge references robots, we navigate to the [robots.txt](http://saturn.picoctf.net:64710//robots.txt) page of the website to see some interesting text.

I tried visiting the disallowed pages but those didn't pan out, neither could I brute-force the addresses as it is an `nginx` server; however I did recognise the 3 lines of gibberish as `base64` encoded text. The middle line, `anMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA==`, was decrypted to an address, `js/myfile.txt`. Visiting the [address](http://saturn.picoctf.net:64710/js/myfile.txt) gives us the flag.
