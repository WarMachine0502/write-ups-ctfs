## **morse-code**  
As directed by the challenge, we open the file `morse_chal.wav` in Audacity to get the following waveform.

To convert the waveform to text we can use any [online tool](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html) for converting morse code audio to text to get the flag.
