# **PicoCTF**

[PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/) is a free cyber-security program presented  by security and privacy experts at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), in the format of CTF-based challenges and problems.  
Challenges have been divided into multiple domains as given below, to facilitate learning different types of attacks, with each challenge amounting to a set number of points, which contribute to your picoGYM Score. In addition to this, we can also group challenges based on their Original Events when they were made and released.
