## **Lookey here**  
We have got a file named `anthem.flag.txt`. First I check the filetype(`unicode`) and then check the metadata.

I couldn't find anything, so I decided to go through the file's contents. The hint to the challenge was very useful here - I simply ran `cat anthem.flag.txt | grep picoCTF{` to get the flag.

>> flag: picoCTF{gr3p_15_@w3s0m3_2116b979}
