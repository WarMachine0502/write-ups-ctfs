## **Python Wrangling**  
We have a python file named `ende.py`. Executing the file simply through python3 returns a response that the file has to be decoded. Hence we decode the python file using the flag as `python3 ende.py -d flag.txt.en`, which successfully decodes the file and gives out the flag after getting the password from the ``pw.txt`` file.
