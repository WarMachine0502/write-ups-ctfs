## Binary Exploitation


* **basic-file-exploit**  
The challenge tells us to connect to a `netcat` address via `nc saturn.picoctf.net 55825` to launch a program as defined in the challenge description.

Looking at the C file, we see some anomalies in the `data_read` function; it uses the `strtol()` to check if the input is equal to 0. Since `strtol()` converts the initial part of the string to long inteer values, I broke through the program when I tried to enter a string when asked for a number by the print option, thus obtaining the flag.

>> flag: picoCTF{M4K3_5UR3_70_CH3CK_Y0UR_1NPU75_68466E2F}
